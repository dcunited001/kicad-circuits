#+DESCRIPTION: notes


*** Files

+ Spice not generated from project schematics go in =./spice/=
  - the =KiCad-Spice-Library= is in there as a git submodule
+ Each of the other folders are individual circuits via eeschema.
  - The naming should improve, but class-related circuits will start with a
    chapter number.
+ For now, each eeschema circuit should stand on its own.
  - The simulations are a inflexible & tough to change within eeschema.
  - Circuits with more complex logic should be exported to simulate via
    =NgSpice.jl=.
+ For each project
  - I may generate subdirectories for =data=, =plots=, etc.
  - These will be modeled on [[https://github.com/danielrioslinares/ngspice-examples/blob/master/lpflt_rc/Makefile][danielrioslinares/ngspice-examples]], although will
    not likely use a =Makefile=.
